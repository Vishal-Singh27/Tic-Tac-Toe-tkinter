# CS50p Final Project
# Introduction
This is readme of my CS50p Final Project, My name is Vishal Singh, I am from India.
This project is Tic-Tac-Toe game, I made the gui using tkinter, and implemented the AI using Minimax algorithm.
I have also created executable files of it in mac-executable and window-executable.
Future updates on software on [Github Repo Link](https://github.com/Vishal-Singh27/Tic-Tac-Toe-tkinter/)

## Requirements
The only requirement is to have python install!
> If you dont have python installed, in windows install it by microsoft store and in mac install via Homebrew.

## Usage
Go to the mac-executable or windows-executable folder depending on your system and run the executable file "Tic-Tac-Toe".
